You have hidden the \iMusicBox{} in \sPacketA{\MYloc{}}. If you suspect that someone is trying to find the \iMusicBox{\MYname} and restore it, you will have to stop them. One way you can do this is by moving the \iMusicBox{\MYname}. Unfortunately you wont have a lot of time to do so, so it will become progressively more difficult. 

If you choose to move the \iMusicBox{\MYname} from one location to another, it must be moved in this order. You should find the next packet before you begin the process of moving the box, especially Since the box is two hands bulky and unstashable (except in the special packets).

You may use \aLesserDispel{} to assist in {\bf breaking} the locks, but you may NOT use \aLesserDispel{} to assist in reinstalling them. Installing or breaking locks is otherwise the same as on the \gDecking{} greensheet. 

{\bf To move the \iMusicBox{\MYname} from \sPacketA{\MYloc{}} to \sPacketB{\MYloc{}}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find ``\sPacketB{}'' in \sPacketB{\MYloc{}}
  \item Go to ``\sPacketA{}'' and break the magical lock of difficulty 3. 
  \item Take the \iMusicBox{\MYname} to ``\sPacketB{}''. 
  \item Install a magical lock with difficulty 1.
	\item Place the box in ``\sPacketB{}''
\end{enumerate}

{\bf To move the \iMusicBox{\MYname} from \sPacketB{\MYloc{}} to \sPacketC{\MYloc{}}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find ``\sPacketC{}'' in \sPacketC{\MYloc{}}
  \item Go to ``\sPacketB{}'' and break the magical lock of difficulty 2. 
  \item Take the \iMusicBox{\MYname} to ``\sPacketC{}''. 
  \item Install a magical lock with difficulty 2.
	\item Place the box in ``\sPacketC{}'', 
\end{enumerate}

{\bf To move the \iMusicBox{\MYname} from \sPacketC{\MYloc{}} to \sPacketD{\MYloc{}}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find ``\sPacketD{}'' in \sPacketD{\MYloc{}}
  \item Go to ``\sPacketC{}'' and break the magical lock of difficulty 1. 
  \item Take the \iMusicBox{\MYname} to ``\sPacketD{}''. 
  \item Install a magical lock with difficulty 3, then install a {\bf second} magical lock with difficulty 2.
	\item Place the box in``\sPacketD{}''
\end{enumerate}
