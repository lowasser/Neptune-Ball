As a member of the Guardian's Guild, you have the ability to perform a background check on anyone in game. This process will take some time, but may provide you with valuable clues as to the identity of your mafia suspect.

To do a background check on someone:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Spend 3 minutes engaged in conversation with your target. You need this time to deduce what would be most useful records to check. Try to get as much information about their past out of them as possible.
\item Start a 5 minute timer
\item See a GM for what you learned.
\end{enumerate}

You may wish to keep notes on this sheet regarding what you have learned about various people. This trumps the usual restriction on 

Once you have found your suspect, you may continue to perform background checks on people if you want to.
