As a member of the Guardian's Guild, you have the ability to perform a background check on anyone in game. This process will take some time, but may provide you with valuable clues as to the identity of your mafia suspect.

To do a background check on someone:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Spend 3 minutes engaged in conversation with your target. You need this time to deduce what would be most useful records to check. Try to get as much information about their past out of them as possible.
\item Go to the entry way and put both hands on the ``\sBackgroundCheck{}'' for 30 seconds. Then lift the sign and write the person's name on ``\sBackgroundCheckTwo{}''.
\item Return 5 minutes later and cross out their name on ``\sBackgroundCheckTwo{}.'' (This will help you keep track of who you have investigated.)
\end{enumerate}

Once you have completed these task, you may open the ``\nMafia{\MYname}'' mempacket page corresponding to your target's badge number.

Once you have found your suspect, you may continue to perform background checks on people if you want to.
