The Daily Currents Reporter

You originally emigrated from the Indian Ocean over 20 years ago. You came for college, and a degree in journalism. In the time since, you have made quite a name for yourself. You have a knack for explaining politics in a way that the merfolk of \pAtlantis{} can understand. For the past few years, you have been the Castle correspondent (Like being the white house correspondent) for the Current. In that time you have become suprisingly close to \cKing{\King} \cKing{}. \cKing{\They} relies on you to ferret out what's going on and let \cKing{\them} know about it before it becomes a problem. It's kind of fun to be the \cKing{\Monarch}'s little birdie. It gives you an unprecedented position from which to report on the goings on at the Castle. When it was announced that there would be peace talks at the ball today, the Current didn't even have to go to the trouble of securing you a ticket, \cKing{\King} \cKing{} delivered your invitation personally.  Your primary objectives at the event will be 1) to ensure that nothing gets swept under the rug - the people of \pAtlantis{} must know! and 2) Keep \cKing{\King} \cKing{} from being surprised by any underhanded dealings by finding them out and telling him. 

It might be a stretch to call you a gossip, but only a small stretch. You, have no intention of missing a moment of the action. You expect that with all the politics and obligatory back room deals, at least one person’s reputation will end up in ruins. It's not that you take pleasure in their fall, but that you take pleasure in being the one to break that news to the wider community.

You don't usually do character features, but with royalty from \pPacifica{} present, you are very interested in getting an interview with \cPrince{\them}. You know that such a piece could be a tough sell to \pAtlantis{}ns who have been at war with \pPacifica{} their whole lives (the war has been going on for 100 years. No one is alive who remembers a time of peace), but such an article presenting the \pPacifica{}ns in a good light would go a long way toward making peace last. It is hard to be at war with merfolk just like you. It is much easier when they are some scary unknown.

Still, \pAtlantis{} is your home, and you want to make sure any treaty passed tonight does right by your adopted country. Don't let the council members from the various guilds exploit the treaty to their advantage at some cost for the country at large, and definitely don't let the council or the \cKing{\King} be hoodwinked by the \pPacifica{}ns. If a proposed treaty is not favorable to \pAtlantis{}, make sure they know that signing it would be a betrayal of the country and will not go unnoticed (feel free to play up the nationalism as much as you find entertaining). One small part of this is the royal marriage of \cPrincess{} to \cPrince{}. Such marriages are traditional to seal alliances. You also know the folly of royalty marrying non-nobles. Your native country of the Indian Ocean was wracked by years of civil war after the merchants demanded that the Prince marry someone of their choosing. You don't want to see that happen here too. (Feel free to play the classism up as much as is entertaining). 

You converted to the Church of the Tides not long after arriving in \pAtlantis{}. Most \pAtlantis{}ns are at least nominally believers. You find many of the teachings resonate with you, especially the practical messages like the dangers of predators, and weresharks. (yes, they are a real thing, and yes, they do attack merfolk on an infrequent basis. Say one or two attacks a year.)

On the other hand, your mind is not at all made up on the question of mages and magic. You think the ban on magic and dissolving of the magicians guild was really a power grab by the throne, since they already de facto control the Explorer’s guild since so much of the royal family joins their rank. You should do your best to make a decision at the event, based on events you witness and talk you hear. You hope to eventually write an informed opinion piece on the matter, assuming you don't uncover some dastardly plot. As such a well respected writer, your piece would carry a lot of weight to weigh public opinion one way of the other on the issue.

Over the course of the event, you are encouraged to write up small articles, or even “eddies” (tweets), and post them in the grand ballroom, so everyone attending knows what you are telling the rest of the country.
